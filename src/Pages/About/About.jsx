        <p className="aboutus-paragraph">The objective of the symposium is to bring the young budding engineering 
            graduates together to present their findings and discuss future trends, 
            directions and new challenges in the Electronics & Communication field. 
            This symposium aims to intensify the information exchange of their ideas 
            in theoretical research and practical developments.
            This symposium can be used to discuss what and how the student community 
            can facilitate the process of technology development. This would prove to 
            be a boon to students. It will be a forum for new ideas and concepts and 
            also would endeavour to examine the different dimensions of Electronics & 
            Communication field.
